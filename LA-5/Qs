### QUESTIONS

1.WAP to swap kth node from beginning with kth node from end in a Linked List
Ans: 1.c

2.Given a linked list, write a function to reverse every k nodes. (where k is an input to the function). If a linked list is given as
12->23->45->89->15->67->28->98->NULL and k = 3
then output will be 45->23->12->67->15->89->98->28->NULL.
Ans: 2.c

3.Given a singly linked list, rotate the linked list counter-clockwise by k nodes. Where k is a given positive integer. 
For example, if the given linked list is 10->20->30->40->50->60 and k is 4, the
list should be modified to 50->60->10->20->30->40. Assume that k is smaller than the count of nodes in linked list.
Ans: 3.c

4. WAP to insert a new node at the beginning of a doubly linked list.
Ans: 4.c

5. WAP to delete a node after a certain node of a single circular linked list.
Ans: 5.c

6. WAP to insert a new node at the beginning of a single circular linked list.
Ans: 6.c

7.WAP to remove the duplicates in a sorted double linked list.
Ans: 7.c

8. WAP to check whethere a doubly llinked list is palindrome or not.
Ans: 8.c
