1. GIVEN A STACK, SORT IT USING RECURSION.
Answer: 1.c

2.GIVEN A STACK, RECURSIVELY REVERSE IT ONLY USING ITS ABSTRACT DATA TYPE(ADT) STANDARD OPERATIONS, LIKE PUSH(),POP() ETC.
Answer: 2.c

3. Design a stack that supports getMin() in O(1) time and O(1) extra space
Answer: 

4.Given set of time intervals, the task is to find the intervals which donâ€™t overlap with the given set of intervals.
interval arr[] = { {1, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 5}, {7, 9} }  [5, 7]
Answer: 4.c

5.First off, some definitions.
Anarray of length at least 2 having distinct integers is said to be
fantabulous iff the second highest element lies of the highest value.
For example, is fantabulous as the second-highest value lies to the
left of highest value .
For every fantabulous array, we define a
fantabulous pair where denotes the index of the second-highest value
(1-indexed) and denotes the index of the highest value (1-indexed). In
the above array, the fantabulous pair is (3, 5).
Mancunian challenges you to solve the following problem. Given an array, find the
total number of fantabulous pairs over all its subarrays.
The first line contains an integer denoting the length of the array. The
next line contains integers denoting the elements of the array.
Output a single integer which is the answer to the problem.
1 <= N <= 106
1 <= array elements <= 109
Array elements are distinct.
Answer: 5.c

6. Alice is rearranging her library. She takes the innermost shelf and reverses the order of books. She breaks the walls of the shelf. In the
end, there will be only books and no shelf walls. Print the order of books. Opening and closing walls of shelves are shown by '' and ''
respectively whereas books are represented by lower case alphabets. The first line contains string displaying her library.
Print only one string displaying Alice's library after rearrangement. The first character of the string is '' and the last character of the string is '' 
indicating outermost walls of the shelf.
Answer: 6.c
