1. WAP to calculate x^y(x power y) by writing a function(say POWER) for it.
2.WAP to test whether a number n is palindrome number or not using function.
3.WAP to count number of digits of a positive integer n by using recursion.
4. WAP to find the first digit of a number using function. Example : if the number is 1234. output is 1.
5. WAP to read a number and delete the even location digit of that number.Example : i) input 1234. output is 13.
ii) input 357 output is 37
iii) input 7637272 output is 7322
6. WAP to test whether a number num (num is entered through keyboard) is a number in the Fibonacci sequence or not.
7.WAP to find out the sum of n elements of an integer array a[] by using recursion.
8.WAP to find the LCM of two numbers a and b by using a suitable function (say LCM) for this.
9. WAP by designing a recursive function to calculate the sum of all even digits of any given integer.
10. WAP to find the factorial of a number n by writing a recursive function for it.
11. WAP to store n employeeâ€™s data such as employee name, gender,
designation, department, basic pay. Calculate the gross pay of each
employees as follows:
Gross pay = basic pay + HR + DA
HR=25% of basic and DA=75% of basic.
12.WAP to add two distances (in km-meter) by passing structure to a function.
13. Modify 12 to return a structure pointer
14.WAP return an array of structure using pointer.
